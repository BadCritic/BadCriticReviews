            I was searching for a movie to watch with my mom while eating lunch, and this looked like a good film. Who know this might be my treasure even though other 
            people gave it 1.9 on LB? Trailer looked awesome, full of sci-fi shit with world-ending troupe, and one thing you should know is that I am sucker for movies 
            with lot of death and destructions. So, what could go wrong? It should atleast be entertaining right? <sub>yeah...</sub></p>
            <p>Movie started with our main dude trying to sing, and main gal trying to do some banter.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <b>Third-wheeler</b>: Anyone ever tell you guys you bicker like an old married couple?
                <br>
                <b>Main guy</b>: That's 'cause she's my work wife.
            </blockquote>
            <p>From this moment on, I knew writing wasn't going to be strength of the movie just like marriage wasn't going to be strength of the main guy.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Then we are in house of main guy ex-wife (not surprising), who is trying to re-locate somewhere and we get classic and un-original 
            dialogues about moving. Which was pretty needless.</p>
            <blockquote>
                --Pseudo-dialogue--
                <br>
                <b>Mom</b>: We have to re-locate.
                <br>
                <b>Kid</b>: No, I don't want to.
                <br>
                <b>Mom</b>: Why?
                <br>
                <b>Kid</b>: Because daddy *sad face*
                <br>
                <i>Holds somthing important</i>
                <br>
                <i>Mom shushes the kid</i>
                <br>
                <b>Mom</b>: We still gotta move kiddo..
                <br>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Then we jumps to 10 years in future, when even NASA with billon dollar fat bank account couldn't see the shift in earth orbit, our hero who is somehow 
            smarter than NASA saw the shift. Until then no-one even bothered, oh wait they did, we will get back to it later.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Enters our smart nerd, a fat guy with a tin cans of coloured pills. How original! Where did all other species of nerds go off? 
            Where is tall and thin guy, or maybe bearded wizard? I think they should get chance at spotlight too.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; He entered some professor office, who didn't even bother to lock the door (locking doors is for normies right?) without a 
            single camera noticing him (huh, what are cameras?). He also conviently log in professor account with password he already knew. Then proceed 
            to call observatory and very conviently the guy there couldn't identify he was fake. Then again, very conviently, that professor actually uses other email than 
            school one. Maybe this wasn't his first rodeo, but even then it make no cams, no locks and the guy not knowing real professor make it really awful writing 
            that is very convient to writers.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Next, in fast food drive-in, he just eyeball some spreadsheet and knows that world gone shitters, which is kinda understandable, 
            I mean I too eyeball my budget spreadsheet and immediately know that I fucked up. <sub>But but he is genius...</sub> STFU.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I ain't writing more, this shit is just like that for next 1 hour 50 mins. More and more lazy writing that is super convient 
            for the writers. We give it a good 9 points in yawn category, in real life I actually got 1-2 yawns while watching this film, where my mom was already 
            asleep 40 mins in. It could have been worse for me were I hadn't been hoping for film to finally get good.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; There are just cringe writing here and there, like frequent mention of elon, which I then understood what would happen if 
            you give a pen and a paper to an elon fan. Also, this dude ruining what was little teary emotional moment in otherwise a dry film by mentioing his bowel 
            were fucked. Also classical wimpy nerd sterotype.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Again talking about stereotype, we got a fat nerd + awkward + bad-bowels + smarter-than-NASA-scientist + nobody-believe-him 
            + whose-conspiracy-theory-is-true. I could go on and on about entire film. I give good 4 points in puke category.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Acting felt dry and unserious, there weren't any moment where I thought "this guy is good ngl". So maybe 2 point 
            in puke category.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I am not giving it full points in yawn and puke categories because there were some things that I found interesting. We got our 
            classic case of help-I-am-stuck-under-fallen-tree trope that happen which serve no purpose to plot, but it was low-key interesting to me that it got 
            solved with help of moon gravity lifting off the fallen tree. This was convient, but wasn't ass-pull. Another case, where in the end, both main guy and 
            gal escaped conviently because earth was just few KMs from moon. Again convient and not ass-pull. Lastly, the reveal that the aliens were actually humans, 
            was something that caught me little off-guard, because I was expecting some Arrival type alien, and felt little world-bulding and lore-revealing pleasing. 
            I am also sucker for world-building and lore-revealing themes in movies and tv-series.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Credits where it due, I found CGI to be actually pretty good, I couldn't find dull moment with it. So, doing it a bit of
            favour, I will deduct 2 points from yawn category, because of things I found interesting and the CGI.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The rage category remains untouched, because there wasn't much reason to get angry.</p>
            <p>Concluding, this movie is way longer then it should be, it have many pointless scene which doesn't advance the plot or deliver any value. The writer are 
            un-original and lazy, they casually deleted obstacle in character's path so they can comfortably reach movie's conclusion. The only thing to it's rescue is CGI
            and someone like me who love diaster movies. Overall, it's a movie that you can watch at relative house on TV when you are bored.</p>
            <p>Calculating our final ratings. Yawn: 9 - 2 = 7. Rage = 0. Puke = 5 + 2 = 7. I am pretty graceful here since it's a diaster movie.</p>
