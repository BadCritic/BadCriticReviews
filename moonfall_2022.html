            I was searching for a movie to watch with my mom while eating lunch, and this looked like a good film. Who know this might be my treasure even though other
            people gave it 1.9 on LB? Trailer looked awesome, full of sci-fi shit with world-ending troupe, and one thing you should know is that I am sucker for movies
            with lot of death and destructions. So, what could go wrong? It should atleast be entertaining right? <sub>yeah...</sub></p>
            <p>Movie started with our main dude trying to sing, and main gal trying to do some banter.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <b>Third-wheeler</b>: Anyone ever tell you guys you bicker like an old married couple?
                <br>
                <b>Main guy</b>: That's 'cause she's my work wife.
            </blockquote>
            <p>From this moment on, I knew writing wasn't going to be strength of the movie just like marriage wasn't going to be strength of the main guy.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Then we are in house of main guy ex-wife (not surprising), who is trying to re-locate somewhere and we get classic and un-original
            dialogues about moving. Which was pretty needless.</p>
            <blockquote>
                --Pseudo-dialogue--
                <br>
                <b>Mom</b>: We have to re-locate.
                <br>
                <b>Kid</b>: No, I don't want to.
                <br>
                <b>Mom</b>: Why?
                <br>
                <b>Kid</b>: Because daddy *sad face*
                <br>
                <i>Holds somthing important</i>
                <br>
                <i>Mom shushes the kid</i>
                <br>
                <b>Mom</b>: We still gotta move kiddo..
                <br>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Then we jump to 10 years in future when even NASA with billions of dollars in a fat bank account couldn't see the shift in earth orbit, our hero who is somehow
            smarter than NASA saw the shift. Until then no one even bothered, oh wait, they did, we will get back to it later.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Enters our smart nerd, a fat guy with a tin cans of coloured pills. How original! Where did all other species of nerds go off?
            Where is the tall and thin guy, or maybe a bearded wizard? I think they should get a chance at the spotlight too.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; He entered some professor's office, who didn't even bother to lock the door (locking doors is for normies right?) without a
            single camera noticing him (huh, what are cameras?). He also conveniently logged in to the professor's account with a password he somehow knew. Then proceeded
            to call the observatory and very conveniently the guy there couldn't identify he was fake. Then again, very conveniently, the professor actually uses some other 
            email over the school one. Maybe this wasn't his first rodeo, but even then no cams, no locks and the guy not knowing the real professor made it a really awful 
            writing, which was very convenient to writers.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Next, in fast food drive-in, he just eyeballs some spreadsheet and knows that world gone shitters, which is kinda understandable,
            I mean I too eyeball my budget spreadsheet and immediately know that I fucked up. <sub>But but he is genius...</sub> STFU.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I ain't writing more, this shit is just like that for next 1 hour 50 mins. More and more lazy writing that is super convenient
            for the writers. We give it a good 9 points in the yawn category, in real life I actually got 1-2 yawns while watching this film, where my mom was already
            asleep 40 mins in. It could have been worse for me were I hadn't been hoping for the film to finally get good.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; There is just cringe writing here and there, like the frequent mention of Elon, which I then understood what would happen if
            you give a pen and a paper to an Elon fan. Also, this dude ruined what was a little teary emotional moment in otherwise a dry film by mentioning his bowel
            was fucked. Also classical wimpy nerd stereotype.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Again talking about stereotype, we got a fat nerd + awkward + bad-bowels + smarter-than-NASA-scientist + nobody-believe-him
            + whose-conspiracy-theory-is-true. I could go on and on about the entire film. I give a good 5 points in the puke category.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Acting felt dry and unserious, there wasn't any moment where I thought "This guy is good ngl". So maybe 2 points
            in the puke category.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I am not giving it full points in yawn and puke categories because there were some things that I found interesting. We got our
            classic case of the help-I-am-stuck-under-fallen-tree trope that happens which serves no purpose to plot, but it was low-key interesting to me that it got
            solved with the help of moon gravity lifting off the fallen tree. This was convenient but wasn't ass-pull. Another case is where in the end, both the main guy and 
            gal escaped conveniently because Earth was just a few km from the moon. Again convenient and not ass-pull. Lastly, the reveal that the aliens were actually humans,
            was something that caught me a little off-guard, because I was expecting some Arrival-type alien, and felt a little world-bulding and lore-revealing pleasing.
            I am also a sucker for world-building and lore-revealing themes in movies and tv-series.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Credits where it due, I found CGI to be actually pretty good, I couldn't find a dull moment with it. So, doing it a bit of
            a favour, I will deduct 2 points from the yawn category, because of things I found interesting and the CGI.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The rage category remains untouched because there wasn't much reason to get angry.</p>
            <p>Concluding, this movie is way longer than it should be, it has many pointless scenes which don't advance the plot or deliver any value. The writers are
            un-original and lazy, they casually delete obstacles in the character's path so they can comfortably reach the movie's conclusion. The only thing to its rescue is CGI
            and someone like me who loves disaster movies. Overall, it's a movie that you can watch at relative house on TV when you are bored.</p>
            <p>Calculating our final ratings. Yawn: 9 - 2 = 7. Rage = 0. Puke = 5 + 2 = 7. I am pretty graceful here since it's a diaster movie.</p>
