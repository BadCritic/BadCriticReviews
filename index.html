            <p style="text-align: center;">Hi! I am BadCritic and I review shitty movies! or maybe movies that are considered shitty!</p>
            <hr>
            <p><b>Why review shitty movies? why not cool movies?:</b> Well, my reasons are two folds. <b>One</b>, because if everyone is out here reviewing cool movies, then who gonna reviews bad stuffs? <b>Second</b>, I believe people taste can be shitty too, just like how rest of the world outside "great" britian cries in digust over bland british foods that british people themselves have no problem with. One man's trash is another man's treasure.</p>
            <p><b>How are the movies going to be rated?:</b> My criteria is simple, entertain me. Everything is allowed and can be forgiven. I rate in [0-10], in <b>yawn</b>, <b>scowl</b> and <b>puke</b> categories. <b>Yawn</b> means how much boring and/or predictable is the plot, story, etc? Does it lulls me to sleep? <b>Scowl</b> means how much stupid are the characters, writing, etc? Does it makes me punch the screen? <b>Puke</b> means how disgusting is the writing, directing, acting, etc? Does it make me say "ewwwtf" every second?</p>
            <p><b>Again, why do this? why burden yourself with crimes of others?:</b> Once upon a time during summer vacation of 2024, I had lot of free time on my hand. So, I decided to use it to watch movies and reduce my ever-growing watchlist on LetterBoxd. After watching any movie that didn't match people's LB ratings with my LB ratings, I would holler and rant to my friend about how everyone is stupid except me.<br> &emsp; &emsp; With every exchange, I began to find out that I actually likes trash films or films that are considered trash! But at same time there were films that others totally loved and I thought were trash. So, I jokingly told my friend that I will do a "bad movie hackathon", do review and post it on some blog. Maybe not so jokingly, but I guess you get it. <br> &emsp; &emsp; Lastly who knows what gems I could find on my journey? Afterall, One man's trash, truly is another man's treasure.<p>
            <p><b>Anything you would like to say?:</b> How much I shit on movie or how much I praise it, depends upon polarity of people's opinions and my opinions. If others really loved it and I absolutely hate it. I gonna shit on it hard. But if it exact opposite, than I am gonna defend my precious baby with all my might.</p>
